# Vertical chart from array with random values at each run

Ex. (198) - Vertical chart from array with random values at each run, is presented here in three programming languages: Python, MATLAB, and JavaScript. Although the implementations differ in syntax, the underlying concept remains identical across all three versions. Each code sample is reproduced from its respective volume of the series <i>Coding Examples from Simple to Complex</i> (Springer, 2024).
